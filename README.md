# Story.AI

Assists with writing stories from novel ideas.

<!--
## TODO

- [ ] During outline generation create a changelog for the world setting, character traits and relationships
- [ ] Have the tool review the outline and story contents generated for improvements to story structure and formatting
- [ ] Random button should load one of the existing shared stories (need to figure out which ones are complete, maybe mark them after uploading?)
- [ ] Analyse the rest of the story for inconsistencies with summary and other chapters
- [ ] Replace content `innerHTML = ""` without affecting layout or scrolling
- [ ] Tag shared story with the title of the story for easier linking (take into account multiple stories with the same title)
- [ ] Add graphic novel visualisation
